This RPM sets up a directory for git repositories.

The RPM includes a script create-new-git-repo for creating new repositories.
New git repositories are configured to use UNIX groups for access control.
You can configure which users have which groups in the "users" RPM.
You can also optionally configure email notifications.

After installing this RPM, run "create-new-git-repo --help" for instructions.
